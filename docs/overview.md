### On-Premises to Cloud migration
Document and analyze on-premises environments prior to migration. Evaluate proprietary feature usage in each database. Identify candidates for conversion to other database engines. Examine custom PL/SQL and other database related program logic (stored procedures, triggers, scripts, and so on) and re-write for the cloud.

Download the DDL to refactor a single monolithic schema for use in microservices. Find direct and indirect dependencies for objects and groups of objects. Extract SQL statements from stored procedures. Catalog and analyze Oracle database instances on Oracle Cloud Platform or other Cloud providers.

### Custom development
Document custom code in your Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) application database. Review the schema definitions in your E-Business Suite database. Examine dependencies before a schema change. Download and diff the DDL for objects in development and test environments.

### License management
Catalog all of your company's Oracle database instances in preparation for a compliance audit. Identify Enterprise Edition feature and option usage. Find Enterprise Edition license instances that could be be downgraded to Standard Edition 2. Review the contents of old databases. What are they really running? Identify targets for consolidation or decommissioning.
